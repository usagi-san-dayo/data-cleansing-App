# data-cleansing-App
The data cleansing App provides lots of functions on data-cleansing with R. This helps you organise datasets automatically and gives you various options for numerical, factorial, Date type objects. The data-organising algorithm is from the package called UdagiSan, which is available on my GitHub repository UsagiSan. I have made this package visually easier to use! 
Also, this app dosen't need to prepare anything like R version and a browser type. You can use this just by double clicking a exe.file without environment-dependency.
A brief chart of this repository is as follows:
```
ElectronShinyApp/
├ locales/
├ resources/
｜         ├ app/
｜         └ saves/ #A default save location
├ swiftshader/
｜            
︙
├ electron-quick-start.exe #A exeucutable file for running shinyApp
︙           
```
To launch this app, go down to directory ElectronShinyApp/, and you'll find a executable file electron-quick-start.exe. Doubleclick it, soon a Electron starts running, and after loading all stuffs on this app, The editor'll be ready to use.
