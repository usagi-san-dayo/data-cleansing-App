# data-cleansing-App
The data cleansing App provides lots of functions on data-cleansing with R. This helps you organise datasets automatically and gives you various options for numerical, factorial, Date type objects. The data-organising algorithm is from the package called UdagiSan, which is available on my GitHub repository UsagiSan. I have made this package visually easier to use!
